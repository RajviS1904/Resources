# Bioinformatics Resources

Welcome to Bioinformatics Resources Repository. I will be compiling important Bioinformatics Resources including but not limited to Books, Workshops, Online courses, Websites, Blogs, Tools and more as I come across them on my journey towards understanding Bioinformatics and Hopefully compile a good enough resource for my fellow amateur Bioinformaticians.
