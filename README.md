# Bioinformatics Resources

Welcome to Bioinformatics Resources Repository. I will be compiling important Bioinformatics Resources including but not limited to Books, Workshops, Online courses, Websites, Blogs, Tools and more as I come across them on my journey towards understanding Bioinformatics and Hopefully compile a good enough resource for my fellow amateur Bioinformaticians.

## Books

1. Computational Genomics with R [Book](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/)
2. Bioinformatics Data Skills by Vince Buffalo [Paid Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/bioinformatics-data-skills/9781449367480/)
3. Python Programming for Biology Bioinformatics and Beyond [Book](https://www.academia.edu/38935090/Pdf_Python_Programming_For_Biology_Bioinformatics_And_Beyond_DOC_JD)
4. Download "Python for Bioinformatics" [Book](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiMkLqh1YjsAhXt4nMBHTP9AecQFjADegQIARAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbiology.hunter.cuny.edu%2Fcellbio%2FPython%25EF%2580%25A8%2FPYTHON%2520FOR%2520BIOINFORMATICS.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3D2vCMOnixriEThvRpCMfR)
