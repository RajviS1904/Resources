## About

Being a computational biology and Bioinformatics enthusiast and coming from a non computer-science background I have realized that open source resources are extremely helpful when starting a journey into this vast field. I plan on curating this repo with helpful resources that can enhance a person's knowledge in the field as I go through my own journey. Hope this helps!

Whoever comes across this feel free to share your valuable resources that you think would help amatuers like me in understanding the depth of Bioinformatics.
