# My Approach to Understanding Bioinformatics

A comprehensive [blog](https://bitesizebio.com/38236/how-to-become-a-bioinformatician/) has been my starting point towards understanding Bioinformatics. While purusing my integrated masters in Life Sciences my goal is to utilize my time constructively in gaining as many skills in the field of Bioinformatics as I can to make myself ready for a Industry job. My focus is will be on working as many hands on projects as possible to gain meaningful experience of what it means to be a Bioinformatician. 

So to begin with I am gonna focus on the basics of Bioinformatics:

## Basics of Bioinformatics

I'll be referring to the [book](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYmoz5uKDsAhXCR30KHRBJCIwQFjAOegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcourses.cs.ut.ee%2FMTAT.03.242%2F2017_fall%2Fuploads%2FMain%2FBasics_of_Bioinformatics.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0oWrEFuUOiYaxKiBAi9TpT) written by Rui Jiang, Xuegong Zhang and Michael Q. Zhang as a reference for the basics of bioinformatics part of the microPhD
